## 📌 Overview
[![Watch the video](demo-thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loO_aYronZI&t=5s)

**Meeting Whisperer** is an intelligent assistant that automates the end-to-end workflow of:

- Summarizing meeting transcripts using GPT-4
- Extracting action items for each participant
- Finding mutual availability across Google Calendars
- Detecting US national holidays
- Scheduling the next meeting via Google Calendar

The project is built using [**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for modular tool orchestration and is designed for real-world productivity and professional collaboration.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meeting-whisperer.git
cd meeting-whisperer
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Add OpenAI API

Create a .env file in the root directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 3. Google Calendar Setup
Go to Google Cloud Console
Create a project → Enable Google Calendar API
Download your OAuth 2.0 credentials → save as client_secret.json
Then authorize your own calendar:
```bash
uv run python authorize_google.py
```
For participants, place their tokens as:
```bash
tokens/<participant_email>.json
```
### 4. Run MCP Tool Servers
In separate terminals:
```bash
uv run python calendar_server.py
```
```bash
uv run python holiday_server.py
```
### 5. Run the Streamlit App
```bash
uv run streamlit run ui.py
```

## 🧬 What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** 

Introduced November 2024 by Anthropic as an open-source protocol, MCP allows for the integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.

In this project, calendar scheduling and holiday detection are offloaded to **dedicated MCP tool servers** — making the system highly modular and extensible.
